# Open Tasks

- Save: Implementation of "Save" to localStorage
- Print : Implementation of a "Print" function
- Alpha Strike : Implementation of Alpha Strike Stats. This is frustrating! As of 26.5.25 the Errata for the "Alpha Strike Heat Conversion" is offline on the official Site and I cannot find it anywhere on the web. The previous section of the rules regarding Heat Conversation is a mess (which is clearly why they made an errata in the first place). Until I can find the correct rules the heat conversion remains unfinished. This currently includes DisplayAlphaStrike component.
- Weapons: OneShot Launchers are among the few official Battletech rules that I find superflous. Therefore they are currently not included in the Mechbuilder. I should add at them at some point.
- Advanced Tactical Rules: There are a ton of weapons and equipment available in the "Tactical Handbook". At some point those should be included as well.
- Existing Mechs: Explore options to tap into the MUL (Master Unil List, which is officially available and lists stats of all existing Battlemechs)
- Tech Eras: Currently the Equipment available is from the IlClan Era. I would like to give every item an Era in which it is available and include the option for Users to choose an Era. Eras would be: Star League, Succession Wars, Clan Invasion, Fedcom Civil War, Jihad, Dark Age and IlClan.
- Weapons: Display some Analysis for the Weaponsloadout of a Mech, a heat profile, an Alpha Strike option (not to be confused with the Alpha Strike System. Alpha Strike means firing all Weapons in one attack).
- Solaris VII: The Solaris VII duel system is old and the current designers are not happy with it. We may see an overhaul in the future but for now, I dont think I will include a conversion to duel rules in the Mechbuilder.
